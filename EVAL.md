## Analysis

### RAG Pipeline Advantages

The RAG pipeline outperformed Structured primarily due to:

1. **Richer Context**: ChromaDB retrieval provides comprehensive coverage with 50 chunks
2. **Natural Language**: Better captures tone, positioning, and narrative flow
3. **Flexibility**: Handles varied data formats from multiple sources
4. **Comprehensive Retrieval**: 10 diverse queries ensure all aspects covered
5. **Jobs Integration**: Successfully incorporates hiring data into Growth Momentum

### Structured Pipeline Advantages

Structured performed better in:

1. **Data Accuracy**: Type-validated information via Pydantic models
2. **Consistency**: Same payload produces deterministic output
3. **Traceability**: Clear provenance for every data point
4. **Schema Compliance**: Guaranteed 8-section structure

## Evaluation Rubric

### Factual Correctness (0-3 points)
- **3**: All facts verified against source data
- **2**: Mostly accurate with minor discrepancies (default for automated evaluation)
- **1**: Several inaccuracies present
- **0**: Major factual errors

### Schema Adherence (0-2 points)
- **2**: All 8 required sections present
- **1**: 6-7 sections present
- **0**: Less than 6 sections

### Provenance (0-2 points)
- **2**: Proper use of 'Not disclosed' (3+ instances)
- **1**: Some use of 'Not disclosed' (1-2 instances)
- **0**: Missing data invented or ignored

### Hallucination Control (0-2 points)
- **2**: No speculative language ('likely', 'probably', 'estimated to be', etc.)
- **1**: Minor speculation (1-2 instances)
- **0**: Frequent speculation (3+ instances)

### Readability (0-1 point)
- **1**: 500-3000 words, proper formatting, clear structure
- **0**: Too short/long or poor formatting

---

## Conclusion

For private equity diligence, both pipelines offer distinct value:

- **Structured Pipeline**: Best for factual accuracy and investment decisions requiring precise, validated data
- **RAG Pipeline**: Best for initial research and qualitative analysis with rich contextual insights

**Recommendation**: Use Structured as primary source for data-driven decisions, RAG for supplementary context and narrative understanding.

### Data Quality Improvements

Both pipelines now benefit from:
- **Jobs Data**: 45 companies with hiring information integrated into Growth Momentum section
- **ChromaDB**: 215 chunks across 50 companies for comprehensive retrieval
- **Concise Prompts**: Bloomberg Terminal-style formatting for investor readability
- **Payload Quality**: 48 companies with structured Pydantic-validated data
