## Company Overview
Baseten is a San Francisco, CA–based software company specializing in machine learning and engineering solutions. Founded in an undisclosed year, Baseten operates within the software and machine learning categories. The company currently has no disclosed leadership team or related competitors, indicating a potential area for growth in visibility and market presence.

## Business Model and GTM
The company sells its flagship product, Brain MAX, a speech-to-text service that provides reliable, performant, and scalable inference, unlocking sub-300ms transcription. The target customers for Baseten include businesses and developers looking for advanced machine learning solutions. Currently, there is no publicly available pricing model or integration partners listed, which may limit customer acquisition strategies.

## Funding & Investor Profile
As of now, Baseten has not disclosed any funding events, total raised amounts, or valuation figures. This lack of funding history may pose challenges in establishing credibility and attracting potential investors or partners. The absence of disclosed rounds and investor names suggests that Baseten may still be in the early stages of its financial journey.

## Growth Momentum
As of November 7, 2025, Baseten reports a headcount of 41 employees, with a significant focus on growth in engineering roles, which comprise 23 of the total positions. The company has 10 open roles in sales/business and 8 in other categories, indicating a balanced approach to scaling its workforce.

## Visibility & Market Sentiment
Currently, Baseten has no recorded visibility metrics, including news mentions, sentiment scores, GitHub stars, or Glassdoor ratings. This absence of visibility data may hinder the company's ability to gauge market sentiment and brand perception, which are critical for attracting talent and investment.

## Risks and Challenges
- No disclosed valuation, which may affect investor confidence.
- Lack of competitive pressure information due to the absence of related companies.
- Limited visibility metrics could impact market awareness and customer acquisition.

## Outlook
Baseten is well-positioned for growth in the machine learning sector, given its innovative product offering, Brain MAX. The current hiring signal, with 41 open positions, particularly in engineering, indicates a commitment to scaling its technical capabilities. However, the lack of funding history and visibility metrics presents challenges that the company must address to enhance its market position and attract potential investors.
