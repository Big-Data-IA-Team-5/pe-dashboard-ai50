## Business Model and GTM
Sierra sells AI Agents to businesses looking to improve their customer interactions. The product offers features such as round-the-clock availability and multilingual support, catering to a diverse range of customer needs.

Currently, there are no publicly listed integration partners or reference customers.

## Funding & Investor Profile
As of now, Sierra has not disclosed any funding events, total capital raised, or valuation figures. This lack of funding history may indicate that the company is in its early stages or has opted for alternative financing methods. The absence of disclosed rounds leaves the total raised and last valuation as "not disclosed."

## Growth Momentum

The company has 30 engineering positions, 21 sales/business roles, and 31 other roles currently open. This hiring strategy indicates a robust demand for technical talent to support the development and deployment of AI Agents. Notably, the company is actively seeking to fill key positions such as Data Engineer and Software Engineer, Site Reliability (SRE), which are critical for scaling its operations and enhancing product offerings.

## Visibility & Market Sentiment
Currently, there are no visibility metrics available for Sierra, including news mentions, sentiment scores, GitHub stars, or Glassdoor ratings. This absence of data may limit the ability to gauge market sentiment and public perception of the company.
